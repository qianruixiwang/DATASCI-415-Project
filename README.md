# Stock Price Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This project forecasts the directional movement of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) by integrating sentiment analysis with historical stock market data. Sentiment scores, derived from the top 25 daily Reddit headlines using VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner), are combined with stock price indicators to enrich predictive features. Machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Random Forest, are trained on data from 2008â€“2015 and evaluated on 2016 data.
